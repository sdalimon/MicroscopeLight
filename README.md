A strap on light ring for my desk microscope

I had bought a cheap microscope that connects to a HDMI monitor or PC over USB.  It included two LED lights on the base, but I found them to not always be easy enough to aim and get enough light.  

This is a ring light that fits around the lens on the microscope.  It is held on with some wire ties to the vertical adjustment mechanism.  

Power is micro USB B.  On my setup I patched it into the USB lights on the base.
